# Contributing to TypeScript OOP Learning Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide is meant to help developers learn TypeScript OOP concepts.

## ⚠️ Are You a Learner or a Contributor?

### 👨‍🎓 If You're Just Learning (Completing Exercises)

**DO NOT create Pull Requests!** Your exercise solutions are for your own learning.

**What you should do:**
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork and set up the upstream remote (see README.md)
3. Complete exercises and commit to your fork
4. **Regularly check for updates** using `git fetch upstream` and `git merge upstream/main`
5. Keep learning at your own pace!

**Why no PRs?** Pull Requests are only for contributing improvements to the learning materials themselves (new exercises, documentation fixes, etc.), NOT for submitting your personal exercise solutions.

See the [Keeping Your Fork Updated](README.md#-keeping-your-fork-updated) section in README.md for detailed instructions on how to stay up-to-date.

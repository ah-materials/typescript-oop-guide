# TypeScript OOP Learning Guide

A comprehensive guide to learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript, complete with detailed notes and hands-on exercises.

## 📚 What's Included

This repository contains everything you need to master TypeScript OOP concepts:

### Study Notes (7 Topics)

1. [**Real-World Use Cases**](00-real-world-use-cases.md) - Understanding when and why to use classes
2. [**Classes Basics**](01-classes-basics.md) - Fundamentals, constructors, properties, and methods
3. [**Access Modifiers & Encapsulation**](02-access-modifiers-encapsulation.md) - public, private, protected, readonly, and static
4. [**Getters and Setters**](03-getters-setters.md) - Property accessors, validation, and computed properties
5. [**Inheritance**](04-inheritance.md) - Extending classes, method overriding, and the super keyword
6. [**Abstract Classes**](05-abstract-classes.md) - Abstraction, abstract methods, and templates
7. [**Interfaces & Polymorphism**](06-interfaces-polymorphism.md) - Contracts, multiple implementations, and polymorphism

### Exercises (6 Challenges)

Progressive exercises that build on each concept:

- [Exercise 1: Basic Classes](exercises.md#exercise-1-basic-classes)
- [Exercise 2: Access Modifiers](exercises.md#exercise-2-access-modifiers)
- [Exercise 3: Getters and Setters](exercises.md#exercise-3-getters-and-setters)
- [Exercise 4: Inheritance](exercises.md#exercise-4-inheritance)
- [Exercise 5: Abstract Classes](exercises.md#exercise-5-abstract-classes)
- [Exercise 6: Interfaces and Polymorphism](exercises.md#exercise-6-interfaces-and-polymorphism)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (v4 or higher)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd typescript-classes
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 📖 How to Use This Guide

### For Learners

1. **Read the notes** in order (00-06):
   - Start with `00-real-world-use-cases.md`
   - Progress through each topic sequentially
   - Take your time to understand each concept

2. **Complete the exercises** from `exercises.md`:
   - Create separate `.ts` files for each exercise (e.g., `exercise1.ts`)
   - Complete one exercise at a time
   - Test your code by running: `npx ts-node exerciseX.ts`

3. **Practice and experiment**:
   - Modify the examples from the notes
   - Try creating your own classes
   - Combine concepts in creative ways

## 🛠️ Running Your TypeScript File

```bash
npm run dev
```

A comprehensive guide to learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript, complete with detailed notes and hands-on exercises.

## 📚 What's Included

This repository contains everything you need to master TypeScript OOP concepts:

### Study Notes (8 Topics + Reference)

All documentation is organized in the [`docs/`](docs/) folder:

0. [**Real-World Use Cases**](docs/00-real-world-use-cases.md) - Understanding when and why to use classes
1. [**Classes and Objects**](docs/01-classes-and-objects.md) - Comprehensive guide covering classes, objects, properties, constructors, methods, and the `this` keyword
2. [**Static Members**](docs/02-static-members.md) - Class-level properties and methods
3. [**Access Modifiers & Encapsulation**](docs/03-access-modifiers-encapsulation.md) - public, private, protected, and readonly
4. [**Getters and Setters**](docs/04-getters-setters.md) - Property accessors, validation, and computed properties
5. [**Inheritance**](docs/05-inheritance.md) - Extending classes, `super` keyword, and method overriding
6. [**Abstract Classes**](docs/06-abstract-classes.md) - Abstraction, abstract methods, and templates
7. [**Interfaces & Polymorphism**](docs/07-interfaces-polymorphism.md) - Contracts, multiple implementations, and polymorphism

**Quick Reference:**

## 📖 How to Use This Guide

### For Learners

1. **Read the notes** in order:
   - Start with [`docs/00-real-world-use-cases.md`](docs/00-real-world-use-cases.md)
   - Then read [`docs/01-classes-and-objects.md`](docs/01-classes-and-objects.md) - this comprehensive guide covers classes, objects, properties, constructors, methods, and `this`
   - Progress through the remaining topics (02-07)
   - Take your time to understand each concept
   - Use the [Keywords Reference](docs/keywords-reference.md) for quick lookups

2. **Complete the exercises**:
   - Each lesson has its own folder in `exercises/` (e.g., `exercises/lesson-01/`)
   - Lesson 01 contains 7 exercises covering all foundational concepts; other lessons contain 5 exercises each
   - Exercises have progressive difficulty (Easy → Medium → Hard)
   - Read the `README.md` in each lesson folder for exercise descriptions
   - Complete exercises in order within each lesson
   - Run your solutions with: `npx ts-node exercises/lesson-<number>/<file-name>.ts`
   - Commit your solutions to your forked repository to track your progress

3. **Practice and experiment**:
   - Modify the examples from the notes
   - Try creating your own classes
   - Combine concepts in creative ways

### Working with Exercises

**Finding exercises:**

Each lesson has its own directory:

```
exercises/
├── lesson-01/          # Classes, Objects, Properties, Constructors, Methods, and `this`
│   ├── README.md       # Exercise descriptions and requirements
│   ├── 01-simple-class-easy.ts
│   ├── 02-class-with-methods-easy.ts
│   ├── 03-multiple-objects-medium.ts
│   ├── 04-object-interactions-medium.ts
│   ├── 05-library-system-hard.ts
│   ├── 06-parameter-properties-medium.ts
│   └── 07-this-context-problem-medium.ts
├── lesson-02/          # Static Members
├── lesson-03/          # Access Modifiers and Encapsulation
└── ... (lesson-04 through lesson-07)
```

**Completing exercises:**

1. Navigate to the lesson folder (e.g., `exercises/lesson-01/`)
2. Read the `README.md` for exercise requirements
3. Edit the exercise TypeScript files (they start as empty templates)
4. Run your solution: `npx ts-node exercises/lesson-01/01-simple-class-easy.ts`
5. Test thoroughly and move to the next exercise

**Running exercise files:**

```bash
# Run exercises from any lesson
npx ts-node exercises/lesson-01/01-simple-class-easy.ts
npx ts-node exercises/lesson-01/08-parameter-properties-medium.ts
npx ts-node exercises/lesson-09/05-complete-application-hard.ts
```

**Saving your work:**

- Commit your exercise solutions in your **forked repository** to track your learning progress
- Your solutions are personal - don't create PRs to submit exercise solutions
- Focus on learning at your own pace!

## 📋 Learning Path

The documentation is structured to build progressively:

```
Basics (Understanding the Foundation)
├── 00: Why use classes?
└── 01: Comprehensive guide - classes, objects, properties, constructors, methods, and `this`
    ↓
Class-Level Features
├── 02: Static members (class-level vs instance-level)
└── 03: Access control (public, private, protected, readonly)
    ↓
Advanced Property Access
└── 04: Getters and setters (controlled access patterns)
    ↓
Advanced Concepts (Code Reuse and Abstraction)
├── 05: Inheritance (code reuse through extension)
├── 06: Abstract classes (templates for subclasses)
└── 07: Interfaces & polymorphism (contracts and flexibility)
```

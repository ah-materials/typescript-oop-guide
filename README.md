## 📖 How to Use This Guide

### For Learners

1. **Read the notes** in order:
   - Start with [`docs/00-real-world-use-cases.md`](docs/00-real-world-use-cases.md)
   - Then read [`docs/01-classes-and-objects.md`](docs/01-classes-and-objects.md) - this comprehensive guide covers classes, objects, properties, constructors, methods, and `this`
   - Progress through the remaining topics (02-07)
   - Take your time to understand each concept
   - Use the [Keywords Reference](docs/keywords-reference.md) for quick lookups

2. **Complete the exercises**:
   - Each lesson has its own folder in `exercises/` (e.g., `exercises/lesson-01/`)
   - Lesson 01 contains 7 exercises covering all foundational concepts; other lessons contain 5 exercises each
   - Exercises have progressive difficulty (Easy → Medium → Hard)
   - Read the `README.md` in each lesson folder for exercise descriptions
   - Complete exercises in order within each lesson
   - Run your solutions with: `npx ts-node exercises/lesson-<number>/<file-name>.ts`
   - Commit your solutions to your forked repository to track your progress

3. **Practice and experiment**:
   - Modify the examples from the notes
   - Try creating your own classes
   - Combine concepts in creative ways

### Working with Exercises

**Finding exercises:**

Each lesson has its own directory:

```
exercises/
├── lesson-01/          # Classes, Objects, Properties, Constructors, Methods, and `this`
│   ├── README.md       # Exercise descriptions and requirements
│   ├── 01-simple-class-easy.ts
│   ├── 02-class-with-methods-easy.ts
│   ├── 03-multiple-objects-medium.ts
│   ├── 04-object-interactions-medium.ts
│   ├── 05-library-system-hard.ts
│   ├── 06-parameter-properties-medium.ts
│   └── 07-this-context-problem-medium.ts
├── lesson-02/          # Static Members
├── lesson-03/          # Access Modifiers and Encapsulation
└── ... (lesson-04 through lesson-07)
```

**Completing exercises:**

1. Navigate to the lesson folder (e.g., `exercises/lesson-01/`)
2. Read the `README.md` for exercise requirements
3. Edit the exercise TypeScript files (they start as empty templates)
4. Run your solution: `npx ts-node exercises/lesson-01/01-simple-class-easy.ts`
5. Test thoroughly and move to the next exercise

**Running exercise files:**

```bash
# Run exercises from any lesson
npx ts-node exercises/lesson-01/01-simple-class-easy.ts
npx ts-node exercises/lesson-01/08-parameter-properties-medium.ts
npx ts-node exercises/lesson-09/05-complete-application-hard.ts
```

**Saving your work:**

- Commit your exercise solutions in your **forked repository** to track your learning progress
- Your solutions are personal - don't create PRs to submit exercise solutions
- Focus on learning at your own pace!

### 🔄 Keeping Your Fork Updated

**IMPORTANT:** This repository is regularly updated with new exercises, bug fixes, and improvements. Check for updates weekly!

**⚠️ DO NOT create Pull Requests from your fork back to this repository** if you're just completing exercises. That's not how you get updates - follow the steps below instead.

#### How to Get New Updates

Every week (or before starting a new lesson), run these commands to pull the latest changes:

```bash
# 1. Check what's new in the original repository
git fetch upstream

# 2. Make sure you're on your main branch
git checkout main

# 3. Merge the updates from the original repo into your fork
git merge upstream/main

# 4. Push the updates to your fork on GitHub
git push origin main
```

**What this does:**
- `git fetch upstream` - Downloads the latest changes from the original repository
- `git merge upstream/main` - Combines those changes with your work (your exercise solutions stay intact!)
- `git push origin main` - Updates your fork on GitHub

**Tip:** If you've been working on exercises in your main branch, commit them first before running these commands!

#### Best Practice Workflow

To avoid conflicts when updating:

1. **Work on a separate branch** for your exercises:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-progress
   ```

2. **Commit your work regularly**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete lesson 3 exercises"
   git push origin my-progress
   ```

3. **When updates are available**, switch to main and update:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Merge updates into your progress branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout my-progress
   git merge main
   ```

This keeps your exercise solutions separate and makes updating much easier!
